= How To Build =
Run

./waf configure build

to build the aotus library.
If you want to select a specific Fortran compiler,
set the environment variable FC.
And for a specific C compiler the environment
variable CC.


= What is Built =
For your convenience the lua library is included in
version 5.1.4-3 (created 2011-03-16T19:06:31-0300),
its objects are completely gathered into the final
libaotus library, so it is only necessary to link
against this single static library to gain the
configuration features of aotus in your Fortran
application.

= Example =
There is an example program built, called aotus_test,
which you will find in the "build" directory, and
use with the provided config.lua in the "test"
directory, where also the source is found.
